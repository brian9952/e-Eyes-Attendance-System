# E-Eyes

E-eyes is an open-source IoT project to build a monitoring system combining 3 main features which are face recognition-based attendance system, 
temperature scanner, and CCTV as its additional feature. This project still on going and not completed yet, but good enough to be our minimum viable product (MVP). For further information
about this product, you can check it out in our pitch deck.
